4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
Alexnet is the best model, because it took the less time to make the predictions.
I chose it over vgg even though they completed the same task at the same time because it predicted the dog_02 image to be an animal, even though it was wrong. Vgg predicted it to be a teddy bear.
